In its simplest form, Form Zero is the art of wielding a lightsaber which had not been ignited. While it seemed silly to many padawan learners, the underlying message could not be ignored. In order for a Jedi to protect and serve the galaxy, they must know when to ignite their lightsaber for combat, and when to leave the weapon at his side. The understanding of another being's situation was key to the knowledge of right and wrong, and any student who could understand the necessity of Form Zero and use it to mediate a solution - without resorting to violence - was truly gifted with the Force."	mustafar expansion

Sometimes called the ideal form, Form I used horizontal side-swipes and parries made with the blade of the lightsaber held upright to push the point of an enemy's blade away during a side-to-side attack. If the attack is a downward slash aimed at the head, Form I simply reversed the motion, with a horizontally-held lightsaber being moved up and down to deflect a blow. All the basic ideals of attack, parry, target zones, and practice drills were created with the Form I style."	mustafar expansion

Form II emphasized fluid motion and anticipation of a weapon being swung at its target, allowing the Jedi to attack and defend with minimal effort. Although many Jedi historians considered Form II to be the ultimate refinement in lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat, it was dropped in favor of Form III combat when blaster weapons became prevalent in the galaxy."	mustafar expansion

Unlike Form II combat, which was developed to work against another lightsaber, Form III was most effective in anticipating and deflecting blaster fire. It stressed quick reflexes and fast positional transition, in order to overcome the rapidity with which a blaster could be fired. It was essentially a defensive technique, emphasizing the non-aggressive Jedi philosophy while reducing the exposed areas of their bodies. In the wake of the death of Qui-Gon Jinn at the hands of Darth Maul, many Jedi turned away from the Form IV style of open, acrobatic fighting and took up Form III in order to minimize the risk of injury or death at the hands of an opportunistic opponent."	mustafar expansion

It emphasized acrobatic strength and power in wielding the blade, attributes which were frowned upon by many traditional Jedi Knights and Masters. It found a niche among the eager padawan learners of the time, who believed that the Jedi needed to become more involved in rooting out crime and evil and eradicating it. This Form was practiced by Qui-Gon Jinn, although his death at the hands of Darth Maul exposed the weakness of Form IV in defending a Jedi's body. Yoda, however, practiced Form IV with such speed that, when coupled with his small size, left an enemy with no undefended parts of his body."	mustafar expansion

Form V was developed by a group of Jedi Masters who felt that Form III was too passive, while Form IV was not powerful enough. It addressed the shortcomings of both forms, in which a Jedi Master may have proved to be undefeatable but could not overcome the enemy. Among the many unique aspects of Form V was the development of techniques in which the lightsaber was used to deflect a blaster bolt directly back at the firer, deliberately to cause harm to the opponent. Many Jedi Masters debated the philosophy of Form V, claiming that it directed inappropriate focus on hurting another being. Others claimed that Form V was simply a way to ""achieve peace through superior firepower."""	mustafar expansion

At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, Form VI was the standard in Jedi fighting techniques, emphasizing the use of techniques from Forms I, II, IV, and V in overall moderation. Many Jedi Masters considered it the ""diplomat's form"", since the user used their knowledge of political strategy and negotiation - along with their own perceptions - to reach a peaceful decision with minimal bloodshed. Many Jedi skilled in Form VI techniques had already spent at least ten years studying the other four Forms, an aspect that many Masters felt was too demanding of the Jedi's time in regards to its benefits on the battlefield."	mustafar expansion

Only through the learning of several other forms can a Jedi begin to understand Form VII, which involved so much physical combat ability that its training brought a Jedi very close to the Dark Side of the Force. Jedi Master Mace Windu studied the Form VII technique. To master Form VII, a Jedi had to employ bold movements and be more kinetic than in any other form. Form VII employed the use of overwhelming power directed through unconnected, staccato movements that kept an opponent continually off-guard. "	mustafar expansion

Agents are recruited from all walks of life for the various skill sets they possess. Agents typically steer clear of issued Imperial armor and weapons, to better blend in with the dregs of the galaxy, unless the mission requires the use of such equipment. They have seemingly bottomless resources to acquire their gear, and typically purchase their tools of the trade on black markets throughout the galaxy, to ensure they obtain exactly what they need to get the job done. Imperial 'Ghosts' are a Rebel urban legend the Empire capitalizes on as a propaganda tool, striking fear and doubt into friend and foe alike; one never knows when, where, or how the 'Ghosts' will appear, or for what purpose...Mak'o Rad is the epitome of an Imperial Agent."

She is considered by both Rebels and Imperials the galaxy's most popular holo-pinup girl - much to the dismay of many Imperial officers. She has been painted by star fighter pilots on the sides of both Rebel and Imperial star ships - again, to the dismay of Imperial officers. Anj'a is also rumored to have a fascination with Night Sister lore and is often seen wearing her customized Rancor bone crafted armor while carrying her Night Sister energy lance to use as a dancing prop. Anj'a is shown performing her number one galactic hit (written by an unknown Gungan master songwriter) 'Booombaaa Boombaa Bombashella' which she performed at the outdoor theater on Vreni island, Corellia!"
