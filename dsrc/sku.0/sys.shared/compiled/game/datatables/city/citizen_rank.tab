rankName	rankSlotId	title	alternateTitle1	alternateTitle2	alternateTitle3	alternateTitle4	alternateTitle5	Comments
s	i	b[0]	s	s	s	s	s	c
cr_replace_me	0							rankSlotId must start with 0
								rankSlotId must be contiguous with no holes and no dupes
								they don't have to appear in contiguous order but the assignment of rankSlotId
								to new slots must be done contiguously

								rankSlotId cannot be reused
								once a rankSlotId has been assigned it cannot be removed
								because that would create a hole and you cannot reuse that rankSlotId for a new slot

								the order that things appear here is the order things will be displayed in the UI/SUI

								you can add as many more alternateTitle columns as you wish
								as long as the alternateTitle columns are named alternateTitle<number> and are contiguous
								for example you can add new alternateTitle columns alternateTitle6 alternateTitle7
								alternateTitle8 alternateTitle9 alternateTitle10 alternateTitle11 and so on

								it is recommended that the rank name and alternate title name start with cr_
								to minimize the chance of a name conflict in the skl_t.stf file which is the
								shared title file for all systems that support title
								"(skills, abilities, collections, guild member rank, city citizen rank)"
